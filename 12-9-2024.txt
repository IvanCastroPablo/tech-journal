New teacher, Juan, talking about AI. What's AI?

He divides it in three layers: AI, Machine learning and Deep learning. 
Let's focus in the first one.

1950's from the start of the AI. 1980's since the start of the machine 
learning. 2000's deep learning, taking advantage from the 
computational advancements.

Some fields of uselfulness of AI:

Text processing, computational vision and image analysis, voice 
assistance, selfdriving cars, searching engines, social networks, 
marketing...

What's a generative AI?

An intelligence that it's able to create content in a similar way as 
an human, such as text, images, music, or even automatised 
translation.

There are several examples of chatbots, or generative text AI, such as 
chatgpt, cloude, Llama, Gemini and many others.

In the field of image generation we have others like midjourney, 
Stable Diffusion...

In the same way, we have several companies that offer the same 
techniques for voice and video generation.

About prompting:

Juan makes a clear difference between prompting an AI and asking a 
search engine: while when using google the user tend to use sort 
requests to get an answer, when prompting the ideal technique is the 
opposite one.

Also, when prompting it is important to make a distinction bewteen 
context and question, and many new users of chatbots make the same 
mistake of not knowing the difference among those two things. Being 
specific is also desirable.
